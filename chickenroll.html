                <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                <li>1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

            <p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Take a glass bowl and add coriander powder, black pepper, garlic paste, cumin powder, low fat yoghurt, turmeric and ginger paste in it. Mix well. Add the freshly washed chicken pieces in the bowl and marinate them with the already added ingredients. </li>
                <li>Now heat oil in a frying pan over moderate flame. Add sliced onions and sauté them on medium flame until light brown in colour. Then add chopped tomatoes and cook for 2-3 minutes. Then add the marinated chicken pieces. Mix well, cover and cook on low flame for 10 minutes. Keep stirring in between. Add ½ cup of water.</li>
                <li>Cover and cook until the chicken is done, stir in between. If the chicken is drying too much, sprinkle some more water. Once done add garam masala powder. Mix well and remove from heat. Keep it aside.</li>
                <li>For the dough, mix well all purpose flower, vegetable oil and salt. Now add water slowly, and knead a very smooth dough. Make 3 or 4 equal sized balls out of it. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each ball into a round paratha (the thickness should be little bit more than the regular chapatis or rotis).</li>
                <li>Heat a tawa on moderate flame and cook the paratha one at a time. Flip and cook both sides without oil first (cook for a minute in total), now add 1 tbsp oil for each side. Flip and cook until light brown spot appears. Avoid too much flipping as the parathas may get hard. Remove from heat and keep the parathas aside.</li>
                <li>Now on a hot paratha, arrange some cooked chicken pieces in a row (make this line little apart from the centre). Drizzle some lemon juice all over the chicken pieces, garnish with some sliced onions, cucumber and chopped coriander leaves. Add few drops of tomato ketchup and chili sauce.</li>
                <li>Roll the paratha firmly and wrap one half of the roll with tissue paper. Fold the bottom part of the tissue paper inside the roll. Your street style Chicken Roll is ready to eat. Enjoy!</li>
